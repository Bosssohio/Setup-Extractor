# Source Code Extractor

## Overview

This C# console application, `SourceCode_SFXArchive`, extracts source code files from embedded resources.  It's designed to protect access to these files with a password.

## Features

* **Password Protection:** The application prompts the user for a password.  Only if the correct password is provided will the source code files be extracted.
* **Resource Extraction:** The application extracts the following files, which are assumed to be embedded resources:
    * Form1.cs
    * Form1.Designer.cs
    * Form1.resx
    * Form2.cs
    * Form2.Designer.cs
    * Form2.resx
    * Program.cs
* **File Output:** The extracted files are written to the application's execution directory.

## How to Use

1.  **Run the Application:** Execute the `ConsoleApp.exe`.
2.  **Enter Password:** The application will display the following prompt:
    ```
    Enter the password to access the source code:
    ```
    Enter the correct password.  (All u need to do is DM me: talkingben_1281 (Question have 10))
3.  **Access Source Code:**
    * If the correct password is entered, the application will extract the source code files to the directory where the application is run.  The application will display:
        ```
        Access granted!
        Resource files extracted successfully.
        ```
    * If the incorrect password is entered, the application will display:
        ```
        Access denied. Incorrect password.
        ```
4.  **Locate Files:** The extracted source code files will be in the same directory as the executable (`ConsoleApp.exe`).

## Technical Details

* **Programming Language:** C#
* **Target Framework:** (Assumed to be .NET Framework or .NET Core/5+)
* **Embedded Resources:** The application uses embedded resources to store the source code files within the executable.
* **Password Handling:** The application uses a hardcoded string for password comparison. **Important Security Note:** In a production environment, you should *never* store passwords in plaintext in the code.  Use secure methods such as hashing with a salt, and store the hashed password.  Consider using environment variables, configuration files, or a secure credential store.
* **File I/O:** The application uses `System.IO.File.WriteAllBytesAsync` to write the extracted resource data to files.

## Code Structure

* `Program` Class:
    * `Main` Method:
        * Prompts the user for a password.
        * Calls `ExtractResourceFile()` if the password is correct.
        * Handles password authentication.
    * `ExtractResourceFile()` Method:
        * Extracts the embedded resource files.
        * Writes the extracted data to individual files (Form1.cs, Form1.Designer.cs, etc.).
        * Handles potential exceptions during file extraction.

## Dependencies

* .NET Framework or .NET Core/5+

## Build Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * .NET SDK (for .NET Core/5+) or .NET Framework SDK.
    * A C# compiler (e.g., `csc.exe` or Visual Studio).
2.  **Compile:** Use the following command-line command (if you have the .NET SDK on your path):
    ```
    csc Program.cs
    ```
    Or, use Visual Studio to create a new Console Application project and add the code.  Build the project.
3.  **Add Resources:**
    * In Visual Studio, add the source code files (Form1.cs, etc.) to the project's resources.  Set the Build Action of each file to "Embedded Resource".
    * If compiling from the command line, you'd use the `/resource` switch of the C# compiler.
4.  **Run:** Run the compiled executable (`ConsoleApp.exe`).

## Important Security Considerations

* **Password Security:** The current code stores the password in plaintext, which is extremely insecure.  **Do not use this approach in production code.** Use a proper password hashing library (e.g., `BCrypt.Net`, `PBKDF2`) to hash the password, and store the hash instead.  Ideally, retrieve the hash from a secure configuration or credential store, not from the code itself.
* **Resource Security:** Embedding sensitive source code within an executable provides a degree of protection, but determined users can still extract it.  Consider additional security measures if the source code is highly sensitive.  Obfuscation can make the code harder to read, but it's not a foolproof solution.
* **Error Handling:** The application displays error messages to the console.  For a production application, implement more robust error handling, such as logging to a file or displaying user-friendly error messages.
